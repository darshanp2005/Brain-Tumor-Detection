# Tumor-detection---Using-YOLOv12
## ðŸ§  Biological Background: Brain Tumor Detection

Brain tumors arise when abnormal cells grow uncontrollably within the brain or its surrounding structures. These tumors can be **benign (non-cancerous)** or **malignant (cancerous)** and may originate in the brain (primary tumors) or spread from other parts of the body (secondary/metastatic tumors).

### ðŸ§¬ Biological Basis
Brain tumors develop due to genetic mutations affecting normal cell behavior. These changes lead to:

- Uncontrolled cell division
- Loss of apoptosis (programmed cell death)
- Invasion into healthy brain tissue

Unlike other cancers, brain tumors rarely spread outside the central nervous system. However, even benign tumors can be life-threatening due to pressure on surrounding brain structures.

### ðŸ§ª Tumor Detection in Practice

**Early detection** is vital for improving outcomes. Brain tumor detection generally involves the following steps:

#### 1. Imaging-Based Identification
- **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)** is the most common and effective method, providing detailed views of soft tissues.
- **CT scans** may be used in emergencies but are less sensitive than MRI.

#### 2. Biological Features Identified in Imaging
Tumors often differ from normal brain tissue in:
- Density and texture
- Irregular shape and margins
- Contrast enhancement (indicates blood-brain barrier disruption)
- Associated swelling (edema) and displacement of structures

#### 3. Histopathological Analysis
After detection through imaging, diagnosis is confirmed with:
- **Biopsy**: Removal of a sample of tumor tissue
- **Microscopic examination**: Determines tumor **type** and **grade** (Grade 1 to 4) based on cell appearance and growth behavior
